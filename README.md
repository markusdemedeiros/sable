# SABLE
(not an acronym)

Little Viper experient in writng down a type system.

TODO: I'm not sure how I could get backwards reasoning to work. SABLE is simple enough that every term is well- or ill-typed, and the current file seems to verify exactly well-typed terms, but the negations of ill-typed terms do not verify.
